- Recurrent NN: 
    Take sentences from a book and "predict" (generate) new text in the same style. Inspired by Raschka.

- Classification on authors (with logistic, Kmeans, FFNN, centroid):    
    Training input: sentences from the ~5 books (embedded ~50 word chunks), with their class (one hot encoded)
    Predict input: embedded ~50 word chunk (from book or from generated text)
    Prediction: class of the prediction input.


Interesting books:
    Austen (Pride and prejudice)
    Wollstonecraft (Frankenstein)
    Dostoyevsky (Crime and punishment)
    Tolstoy (Anna Karenina)
    Kafka (The trial)

(are russians more similar than non-russians? are women more similar than non-women? is kafka just weird? Is Frankenstein gothic?)
